## Description
Time series forecasting is a technique for the prediction of events through a sequence of time. The technique is used across many fields of study, from geology to behavior to economics. The techniques predict future events by analyzing the trends of the past, on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.

Time series forecasting is sometimes just the analysis of experts studying a field and offering their predictions. In many modern applications, however, time series forecasting uses computer technologies, including:

Machine learning
Artificial neural networks
Support vector machines
Fuzzy logic
Gaussian processes
Hidden Markov models
There are two main goals of time series analysis: (a) identifying the nature of the phenomenon represented by the sequence of observations, and (b) forecasting (predicting future values of the time series variable). Both of these goals require that the pattern of observed time series data is identified and more or less formally described. Once the pattern is established, we can interpret and integrate it with other data (i.e., use it in our theory of the investigated phenomenon, e.g., seasonal commodity prices). Regardless of the depth of our understanding and the validity of our interpretation (theory) of the phenomenon, we can extrapolate the identified pattern to predict future events.

## Problem Statement
 
The dataset can be downloaded from given dataset. It contains only 2 columns, one column is Date and the other column relates to the consumption percentage.
